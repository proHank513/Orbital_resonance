# Orbital Resonance Exploration

This project started at the last year in my highschool. My friend and I were curious about the phenomenon "orbital resonance". We decided to simulate it by ourselves. That was the time I started to learn programming. After I enrolled into NTU, I continued this project and made it into a preliminary essay.

## SCRIPT
I used the initial condition of Mimas and Saturn, generated some keplerian mass-less particles composing the ring. By both visualization and barchart, resonance was observed.


## ESSAY
This report was completed as the final project for my General Physics course. It includes the theoretical background of two-body resonance and results of the Saturn ring simulation.
